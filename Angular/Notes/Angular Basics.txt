VERSION HISTORY OF ANGULAR

- Scope: defined to bind data fromt he model to/from the view
- Angular 2 was a complete rewrite w/ no controllers and no scope ... everything was put into componenets.  Developers were really pissed ... no backwards compatability and no guides, just have to rewrite. 

- Version 4: ~ "Angular"
- backwards compatible with Angular 2
