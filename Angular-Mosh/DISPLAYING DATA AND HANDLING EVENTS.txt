DISPLAYING DATA AND HANDLING EVENTS

PROPERTY BINDING

<h2>{{ title }}</h2> 
<img src="{{ imageUrl }}"/>
<img [src]="title" />

	- string interpolation works well for inserting content 
	- property binding in most others
	- only works one way from component to DOM

ATTRIBUTE BINDING

DOM vs HTML
	- DOM is a model of objects that represents structure of document
	- HTML is a markup language we use to represent DOM in text
	- browser creates a tree of objects (DOM) from HTML
	- most attributes of HTML elements have a 1:1 mapping to properties of DOM objects
	- but there are HTML attributes that don't have representation in DOM (like colspan)
	- also properties of DOM that don't have representation in HTML (like textContent)

<td [attr.colspan]="colSpan">

	- tells angular you are targetting the attribute of the HTML element

CLASS BINDING

	<button class="btn btn-primary" [class.active]="isActive"></button>

	- bind this to field or property in our component that evaluates to something truthy

STYLE BINDING

	- sets properties of DOM style object

	<button [style.backgroundColor]="isActive ? 'blue' : 'white'"></button>


EVENT BINDING

Events bubble up the DOM tree

<button (click)="onSave"></button>

onSave($event) {
	$event.stopPropagation();
	console.log("button was clicked", $event);
}

EVENT FILTERING

<input (keyup.enter)="onKeyUp()"/>

onKeyUp(){
	console.log("ENTER was pressed")
}


TEMPLATE VARIABLES

<input #email (keyup.enter)="onKeyUp(email.value)"/>

onKeyUp(email) {
	console.log(email);
}

TWO WAY BINDING

<input [(ngModel)]="email" (keyup.enter)="onKeyUp()"/>

class CoursesComponent {
	email = "me@example.com";

	onkeyUp() {
		console.log(this.email);
	}
}

*** out of the box, will get an error that can't bind to ngModel because it isn't a known property of 'input' ...  don't forget to add FormsModule to app's ngModule's imports array (only comes with browserModule by default)

MODULE: 
	- core
	- forms
	- animations



PIPES

	- format data
	- built in pipes: uppercase, lowercase, decimal, currency, percent
