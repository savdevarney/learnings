TRANSITIONS

For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and a different style must be idneitifed for each state. 

Four transition-related properties: 
    - transition-property
    - transition-duration
    - transition-timing-function
    - transition-delay

TRANSITION-PROPERTY

    - the property that will change in the way identified
    - any other properties included when changing an element's state, but not included within the transition-property will not receive the transition behaviors.
    - separate multiple properties w/ a comma
    - only properties that have an identifiable halfway point may be transitioned: color, font size, etc. 

PROPERTIES THAT CAN BE TRANSITIONED: background-color background-position border-color border-width border-spacing bottom clip color crop font-size font-weight height left letter-spacing line-height margin max-height max-width min-height min-width opacity outline-color outline-offset outline-width padding right text-indent text-shadow top vertical-align visibility width word-spacing z-index

TRANSITION-DURATION

    - seconds and miliseconds, and can be fractional - for ex .2s
    - when transitioning multiple properties, can have multiple durations but they must be declared in the same order as in the transition-property value. 


TRANSITION-TIMING-FUNCTION

    - sets the speed of timing
    - values: 
        - linear
        - ease-in
        - ease-out
        - ease-in-out
        - cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)
        - step-start
        - step-stop
        - steps(number, direction)
    - can declare for multiple properties, comma separate


TRANSITION-DELAY

    - sets a time value, sec or ms that defines how long transition should delay before starting

SHORTHAND

    - ! do not use commas unless you are identifying numerous transitions
