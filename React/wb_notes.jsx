/*
01 INTRODUCTION, Tooling and Editor Setup

things you need to get started 
- nodeJS - all the tooling we use to work with react is in node
- react devtools (chrome plugin)
- babel-sublime - package control (JavaScript-babel)
- console (HyperTerm)

module bundler
- rather than popping in a script tag for each dependencies
- import all the dependencies that you may need
- module bundler takes all your modules and puts them in one bundler
- WebPack to bundle all the JS
- CreateReactApp simplifies the tooling you need to get running ... uses WebPack behding the scene
- package.json will have 

1. in terminal: npm install --> adds node_modules
2. in terminal: npm start --> start CreateReact app to bundle JS and fire up a server for us that auto-reloads.  

This package has installed:
    •   Node.js v8.9.1 to /usr/local/bin/node
    •   npm v5.5.1 to /usr/local/bin/npm
Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.

/*
02 COMPONENTS
- Everything in React is a component
- Reusable piece of your website
- Allows you to build your own tags/components and supply them information

Benefits
- if you have someone on your team that's working on 1 component, can give them that one module / file
- reusable code

In demo: 

components: 
- app (parent component)
	- state
	- props
	- context
- fish
- order
- inventory

*** Changing data elements in STATE changes them throughout
